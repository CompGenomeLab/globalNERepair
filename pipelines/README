This is the pipeline directory, which includes pipilines for preprocessing four NGS methods. 
These pipelines are wrote such a way that they could be used either for downsampling a BED file or just applying the protocol written inside the pipelines. 

##The downsampling part need to be performed at the specified step inside the each type of sequencing method pipeline.
